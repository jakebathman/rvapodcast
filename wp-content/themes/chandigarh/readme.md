# Chandigarh WordPress Theme

Chandigarh WordPress theme is dedicated to the Beauty of the Beautiful City of Chandigarh. Originally created for [ChandigarhOfficial.com](http://chandigarhofficial.com), this theme is built as a child theme for the most beautiful default theme of WordPress Ever - Twenty Seventeen.

Twenty Seventeen is a beatiful theme with clean design, optimum performance and elegant fonts. It still lacked a few things which did not suit our purpose, which encouraged us to create our own theme.
